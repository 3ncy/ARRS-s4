### note_1_15.02.2023
They say someone tried to hack us today, like they did last year. But this time we fought back successfully. I think.<br>
<br>


### note_2_15.02.2023
Talked to the admin. They tried to hack one of our overseers. He's on vacation right now and they won't change his username yet. The account is dead anyway. But the login was cool. Something related to the fairy tale about the sea. Odysseus? The Old Man and the Sea? Nemo? "Sin" something? Whatever...<br>
<br>

> "Sin" something + Odyssea -> "sinbad" - the username

### note_16.02.2023
User observer17-9 is complaining about espionage again. Need to move his messages straight to the trash bin.<br>
<br>


### note_22.02.2023
Judging by the camera feed, user observer13-2 asked analyst23-2 for his password. The latter refused. Have the superiors told him that they won't tolerate this anymore? Guess so. We need to keep a closer eye on him. Maybe he'll come up with some other way to transfer data.<br>
<br>


### note_1_25.02.2023
Well, looks like someone decided to play a game of spies, forwarding archives to each other. Let's see what's going on.<br>
<br>


### note_2_25.02.2023
The archive turned out to be encrypted. Good thing I have a couple of programs to hack into it. Okay, here we go...<br>
<br>


### note_3_25.02.2023
Who sets passwords like that? The hack took less than 10 minutes. The password consisted of the word "password" + six consecutive digits. The inside is full of bullshit. What was the point of encrypting it?<br>
<br>


### note
I think you can figure out the password to the archive yourself. You will need the drawings of this half-artist soon, but not yet.<br>
