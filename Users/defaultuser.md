This time the current admin worked a little harder and their protection has become better since my last "visit", but I managed to get some stuff. Check next file.<br>

p.s. No worries, I'll help you if anything comes up. But with their new upgrades and the ongoing confusion, you'll be able to handle it on your own. Or at least try to :)<br>
