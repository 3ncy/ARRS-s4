### note autosave_messages_20.02.2023
    - Hey, isn't it three years today since you got the job?
    - Almost. In a few days.
    - Congrats anyway. They say you get awarded a coffee mug on a date like this.
    - They used to. Not anymore.
    - That's a shame. Those mugs were cool.
    - Yeah... I also heard that logins are created on some other principle now. 
    - Oh damn. You know how?
    - For observers and analysts, myself included, it used to be like this: "access level"+"day-month (with a dash, without 0) of employment date". Don't know about the new ones.
    - Mine is just random numbers. I couldn't really remember the login properly either way. Have to write it down on sticky notes. At least they don't fine us for leaked login, unlike for the password.

    - Hey. You have an analyst role, right? Can you give me access to one of your projects' analytics?
    - Are you out of your fucking mind? First of all, it's forbidden by the company contract, and secondly, it's simply not safe.
    - Relax.
    - Just request access through your superiors.
    - It takes too long, have to wait about a month for approval.
    - I understand, but there's nothing i can do about it

    - Sup. You down for some coffee?
    - Sure, in 20 mins.
    - Aight. 
***
    - I started composing music at home. Still pretty average at it for now. Wanna listen?
    - Yeah, sure.
    - I sent you the links in the docs.
***
    - What do you think?
    - Itâ€™s cool.
    - Thanks.
