### note note_12.02.2023
I've recently begun to notice that some employees in my department stop discussing things when I walk into the kitchen or pass by. Could they be discussing selling our company secrets? Absolutely! I'll write to some of the overseers. 
### note note_13.02.2023
The overseers are yet to respond. Iâ€™ll message others.
### note note_14.02.2023
I was told that I should stop complaining about other employees. Nonsense. They must be leaking information. I'll have to investigate it myself.
### note note_15.02.2023
Took a picture of a colleague's desk. Found out his username. Unfortunately, after several complaints against him, he stopped writing his passwords on sticky notes and leaving them on his desk. I'll have to watch him enter his password.
### note note_1_16.02.2023
Managed to get part of the password. Goes something like this: rel2as _ _ _ k 5 _ _ . Could not see the rest of the password, sadly. In the middle there are three characters and two digits: either f31 or f32. One digit and a symbol in uppercase. Have to keep trying to figure it out.
### note note_2_16.02.2023
Overheard someone in the hallway saying that they want to standardize logins for some users with a high role. Right now they have cool nicknames, but soon they'll have usernames changed to match their roles. I wonder if the overseers already got their usernames changed. Weren't there only 12 of them? When I asked for a unique login, I was told that it is not possible.
### note note_3_16.02.2023
Found some weird mess in my logs from yesterday. I need to delete it and tell one of the overseers about it!
### note note_17.02.2023
Learned the login of another colleague - observer59-22. Dumbass has the easiest password ever. It's his birthday. I have to find a list of all the employees and their dates of birth somewhere.

### file first_try.txt
A small animal (raccoon?) is carried to the edge of a cliff by a strong wind, and finds itself in another world where it meets a beast (maybe a bear or a minotaur?). The two become friends, but are soon separated when ... when what? hmmm

\*\*\*

Why don't we help him make up a story? He seems hopeless.
